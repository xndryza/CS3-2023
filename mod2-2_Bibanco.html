			<h1>A Silent Voice</h1>
			<p> The Japanese Movie "A Silent Voice" is about forgiveness and atonement. 
			Former elementary school bully Shoya Ishida wants to make amends with the deaf kid he formerly harassed, Shoko Nishimiya.
			Shoya's guilt prompts him to take up sign language and rekindle his relationship with Shoko after she switches schools due to the constant bullying. 
			In addition to addressing the serious effects of bullying, their emotional journey also places a strong emphasis on communication, empathy, and personal development. 
			The movie conveys a positive message of transformation while artfully illustrating themes of friendship, acceptance, and the therapeutic value of human ties.</p>
